# Image-classification-using-CNNs
This project identifies the plant seedlings species from 12 different species using a convolutional neural network

Data Description:
You are provided with a dataset of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its 
unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a 
plant's species from a photo.

Dataset:
The dataset can be downloaded.
The data file names are:
• images.npy
• Label.csv

Context
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has
recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages
